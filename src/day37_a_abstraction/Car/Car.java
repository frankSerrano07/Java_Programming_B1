   SO FAR:

        -Abstract method tell WHAT it does but not HOW
        -Abstract method HAS TO BE in abstract class
        -Whatever class extends ABSTRACT class HAS TO implement ABSTRACT class
        -The FIRST NON-ABSTRACT class HAS TO IMPLEMENT all the MULTI-LEVEL abstract inheritance.
        -Abstract Class can NOT be instantiated / object of it can NOT be created
